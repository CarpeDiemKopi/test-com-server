# .NET COM Test Server

Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition project for creating a COM server for testing in C#.

This should be easier to create using the .NET framework and annotations in C# to test various parts of the COM library.

# Status

**This hasn't been started yet.**

Work is still needed on the main Golang project files before the project will be created. If you would like to start this, then that will be most appreciated.
